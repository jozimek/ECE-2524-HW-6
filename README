This is the repo for the hw 6 assignment.


Discussion Questions:

1)  OO design is always a good idea, but this is a particulary good example because it helps modularize the program.
  This can be applied for other uses, and encapsulates a single job, that it does well.



2) We could make an option that we pass into the deconstructor that specifies which process to use. This would allow 
  general freedom on the issue.

3) We could have it save it's last output to somewhere global the the parent can grab that data from when called for or
  when the parent closes.
