This is the repo for the hw 6 assignment.


Discussion Questions:

1) Yes this is a good example because the code helps modularize the program by breaking up the process functionalities 
into their own objects. This can also be applied for other uses that encapsulate a single job that it does well.


2) We could make an option that we pass into the deconstructor that specifies which process to use. This would allow 
  general freedom on the issue.

3) We could have it save it's last output to somewhere global the the parent can grab that data from when called for or
  when the parent closes.
